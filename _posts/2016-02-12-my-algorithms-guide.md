This project is a list of question that I am going through to prepare for a 
general tech interview. Not only is this great for interview prep, but also
helps to refresh general CS knowledge. The questions are a mixed set from various sources.
I will try to keep the sources as up to date as possible. 

#### Sources
* Cracking the code interview 5th edition 
* Glassdoor
