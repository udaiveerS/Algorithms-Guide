Problem: Find the time complexity for a nested for loop. 

{% highlight java linenos %}
A() {
    int i, j, k ,n;
    for(i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for(j = 1; j <= i^2; j++) {
            for(k = 1; k < n/2; k++) {
                System.out.println("hello world"); 
            }
        }
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

For this problem i found that the best approach is to only worry about how the 
number of times the inner most loop is executed because it will most likely be the highest order of magnitude in terms of work. 

The first loop happens n times. The next loop happens i^2 
<div class="math">
f(x) = \sqrt{1+x} \quad (x \ge  -1)  </div>

<div class="math">
f(x) = \sqrt{1+x}, \quad x \ge -1  </div>

Answer: O(n^4)
