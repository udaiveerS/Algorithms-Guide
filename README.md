#Algorithm-Guide Source Code

This project is a list of question that I am going through to prepare for a general tech interview. Not only is this great for interview prep, but also helps to refresh general CS knowledge. The questions are a mixed set from various sources. 

I will try to keep the sources as up to date as possible.
